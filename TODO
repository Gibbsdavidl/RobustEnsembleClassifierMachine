TODO

* continue docs!!

* function to wipe all the data out of the ensemble. keep only annotations.
  
* plot ROCs for each factor

* get ranked list of predictors across factors and final stages.

## A simple xgb.train example:
param <- list(max_depth = 2, eta = 1, verbose = 0, nthread = 2,
objective = "binary:logistic", eval_metric = "auc")
bst <- xgb.train(param, dtrain, nrounds = 2, watchlist)


max_depth = self$max_depth, 
eta = self$eta, 
nrounds = self$nrounds,
nthread = self$nthreads, 
objective = self$objective, 
eval_metric='logloss', #rmse',  # mlogloss
early_stopping_rounds=2,
verbose = 0

max_depth = self$max_depth, 
eta = self$eta, 
nrounds = self$nrounds,
nthread = self$nthreads, 
objective = self$objective, 
eval_metric='mlogloss',  # mlogloss rmse
early_stopping_rounds=2,
num_class=n_classes,
verbose=0


COMPLETE  


feb 25, 2022

- adding params to simplify parameter list

- more error catching functions


jan 24, 2022

- can import train and test data separately... new example for that.

- all data engineering functions done. 

- produces signature-pairs as predictors.



jan 12, 2022

- finished adding train and test splits on building the ensemble

- recm has one enbl object, that represents one binary representation.
  need to have a enbl for each category given a multi-category label

-Bug in final embl between combined pred and label .
